# Ollie Alphabet

This is a simple android app I made for my son when he was 2. He really took to technology extremely quickly.

The game generates the alphabet in order. The `currentLetter` is bigger and colored to emphasize it. When clicked, it will advance to the next letter in 
a continuous loop. Background letters disappear when clicked a new random letter is generated. Letters continuously move around the screen in random
directions and bounce off the sides of the screen.

Game responds to screen rotation.

# Lydia's Game

A mod of the game I made to display `I` `L` `O` `V` `E` `Y` `O` `U` in sequence when I sneaked the app onto my wife's phone. All of the background letters 
are hearts of random colors instead.

A toggle exists in the code to change it from one game mod to the other.
